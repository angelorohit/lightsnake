# Introduction #
Light Snake is a neon-themed game of snake written as an experiment. The aim of this project was to learn more about HTML5.
Now that the project is done, I hope the original source will be useful to anyone who wishes to dabble in HTML5. 
The game can be played at: [lightsnakegame.appspot.com](http://lightsnakegame.appspot.com "lightsnakegame.appspot.com") 

# How to play #
Your objective is to collect as many dots as possible. 
The faster you get to a dot, the more score you get! 
Try not to be overzealous though, because if your snake collides with itself, it dies!
 
* Use the arrow keys to navigate.
* Pressing P pauses the game.
* Pressing S toggles sound.

# Music Credits #
I borrowed the music track from a great chiptune artist - Ultrasyd.
Do check out his music. It's simply amazing!
